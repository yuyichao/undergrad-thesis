Ultra-cold atoms are atoms that are at a temperature close to absolute zero, typically at the order of micro Kelvin or lower. At these low temperatures, the quantum properties of the atoms, which are usually dominated by thermal effect at room temperature ($\approx300K$), becomes important and the atoms can form interesting new states of matter including Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) for bosons and degenerate Fermi gas for fermions.\\

This thesis presents our work on developing and improving the techniques of trapping and cooling an ultra-cold cloud of Lithium-$7$ atoms and the realization of the Bose-Einstein condensation. The techniques used in this experiment includes Zeeman slower, magneto-optical trap (MOT), gray molasses, static magnetic trap, evaporative cooling, optical dipole trap (ODT), etc.
