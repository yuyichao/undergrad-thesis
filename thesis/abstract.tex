This thesis presents our work on developing and improving the techniques of trapping and cooling an ultra-cold cloud of Lithium-$7$ atoms and the realization of the Bose-Einstein condensate as a first step to study quantum magnetism in optical lattice. The techniques used in this experiment include Zeeman slowing, magneto-optical trapping (MOT), gray molasses, static magnetic trapping, evaporative cooling, optical dipole trapping (ODT), etc. The apparatus has the capability of creating a Bose-Einstein condensate with almost $10^6$ atoms in $10$ seconds as well as tuning the interaction between atoms in a BEC using the Feshbach resonance with a magnetic bias field of up to $\approx1000G$.
