\section{What is Bose-Einstein Condensate}\label{ch1:bec}

Bosons and fermions (spin statistics\cite{spin-statistics1,spin-statistics2})\\
For Bosons, at low temperatures, BEC\\
This section, theory of BEC and observation.

\subsection{BEC in Harmonic Trap}

In the experiment, in order to do cooling and manipulation on the atom cloud, ppl often use trap, in this experiment, the BEC is greated in X-ODT (ref ...)....

\section{Cooling and Traping Theory}
The atoms used in a cold atom experiment often come from an oven at hundreds of degrees C (500 in our experiment) with low density.\\
In order to achieve low temperature and high density required by the BEC condition. Several slowing, traping and cooling steps are usually necessary to ....\\
In this section.... talk about ..... including ....\\

\subsection{Spin Flip Zeeman Slower}

The atoms comes out of the oven has ...\\

\subsection{Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT)}

As in most cold atom experiment, our experiment starts with loading Zeeman slowed atom into a magneto-optical trap (MOT).\\
Provides both cooling and confinement.\\
In order to understand how MOT works, we can consider a one-dimensional model\\

\subsection{Dark State Pumping}
At the end of Laser cooling, the atoms are distributed in different ground states.\\
In order to trap in MT, need to go to 2, 2 / 2, 1 which are the only trappable states at both low field and high field.\\
Choose 2, 2 because we can use dark state pumping which ...
