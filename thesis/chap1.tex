\chapter{Theory}

In this chapter, I am going to describe the theories behind our experiment. It is divided into three parts. The first section explains the theories of cold Bose gas and the Bose-Einstein condensation relevant to the experiment. The second section briefly describes some important properties of the Lithium-$7$ atom. Finally, in the third section, the cooling, trapping and state manipulation techniques used in the experiment are presented, including Zeeman slower (\ref{theory:zeeman}), MOT(\ref{theory:mot}), gray molasses (\ref{theory:gm}), dark state pumping (\ref{theory:pump}), magnetic trap (\ref{theory:mt}) and optical dipole trap (\ref{theory:odt}).

\section{What is Bose-Einstein Condensate}\label{theory:bec}

Every real particles can be classified as one of the two families according to their spins, fermions which have half integer spins and bosons which have integer spins. According to quantum field theory\cite{spin-statistics1,spin-statistics2} the many-particles wave function of identical particles must be symmetric or anti-symmetric under particle exchange for bosons or fermions respectively. For bosonic particles, because of the symmetry of the wave function, the possibility for particles to be in the same state is greatly enhances. As a result, boson gas at ultra-low temperature forms a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), in which almost all of the particles are condensed to the lowest energy state. In the following, the relevant properties of BECs such as critical temperature and density distribution are described.

\subsection{BEC in Harmonic Trap}

Since the wave function of bosons is symmetric, multiple bosons can be in the same state. From this fact, the energy distribution can be calculated for bosons,
\eqar{
  f(\varepsilon)=&\frac{1}{\ue^{\beta(\varepsilon-\mu)} - 1}
}
Since the distribution has to be possitive for all energy states, in particular the $\varepsilon=0$ ground state, we have $\mu\geqslant0$. For all the state except the ground state, this sets an finite upper limit on the number of atoms in each state for a fixed temperature. Therefore, if the number of atoms exceeds a certain value, all the extra atoms will go into the ground state. These atoms condensed in the ground state are called the Bose Einstein condensate.\\
\\
In order to calculate the atom number in the condensate as well as the critical temperature, we can estimate the maximum atom number in the excited states (thermal atoms) with an integral,
\eqar{
  N_{th}=&\int_0^\infty\frac{g(\varepsilon)}{\ue^{\beta\varepsilon} - 1}\ud\varepsilon
}
where $g(\varepsilon)$ is the energy density of states. In our experiment, we create the BEC in a harmonic optical dipole trap (see \ref{theory:odt}) for which the energy density is,
\eqar{
  g(\varepsilon)=&\frac{\pi}{2} \frac{\varepsilon^2}{\hbar^3 \omega^3}
}
\eqar{
  N_{th}=&\frac{\pi}{2\hbar^3 \omega^3}\int_0^\infty\frac{\varepsilon^2}{\ue^{\beta\varepsilon} - 1}\ud\varepsilon\\
  =&\frac{\pi}{2\hbar^3 \omega^3\beta^3}\int_0^\infty\frac{x^2}{\ue^{x} - 1}\ud x\\
  =&\frac{\pi}{2\hbar^3 \omega^3\beta^3}\zeta(3)\Gamma(3)\\
  =&\frac{\pi}{2\hbar^3 \omega^3\beta^3}\zeta(3)\Gamma(3)
}
