\section{What is Bose-Einstein Condensate}\label{ch1:bec}

Bosons and fermions (spin statistics\cite{spin-statistics1,spin-statistics2})\\
For Bosons, at low temperatures, BEC\\
This section, theory of BEC and observation.

\subsection{BEC in Harmonic Trap}

In the experiment, in order to do cooling and manipulation on the atom cloud, ppl often use trap, in this experiment, the BEC is greated in X-ODT (ref ...)....

\subsection{Effect of interaction}

The ... only works for non-interacting.... when adding in interaction.... change shape..... this sub section describe .... in order to measure ....

\section{Cooling and Traping Theory}
The atoms used in a cold atom experiment often come from an oven at hundreds of degrees C (500 in our experiment) with low density.\\
In order to achieve low temperature and high density required by the BEC condition. Several slowing, traping and cooling steps are usually necessary to ....\\
In this section.... talk about ..... including ....\\
