\chapter{Experimental Setup and Results}

In this chapter, I will describe our experimental setup and results. It includes a breif discussion of our optical tables setup (\ref{exp:laser-table} and \ref{exp:machine-table}), the implementation, optimization and performance of each steps (\ref{exp:mot}, \ref{exp:gm}, \ref{exp:pump}, \ref{exp:mt} and \ref{exp:odt}) and finally some basic characteristic of our BEC (\ref{exp:bec}).

\section{Laser System}\label{exp:laser-table}
The laser table is where we prepare all the light resonance with the Lithium-$7$ transition ($\approx671nm$). As discussed in the previous chapter, there are four distinct lines that we need in the experiment, the combination of $D1$, $D2$ with $F1$, $F2$. At a certain time, we need either $D1$ or $D2$ light with the probability of using both $F1$ and $F2$ at the same time and the laser table is designed to do just this.\\

  \caption{Schematic of the laser table design}
  \label{exp:laser-table-design}
\end{figure}\\
As shown in figure \ref{exp:laser-table-design}, since the separation between the $D1$ and $D2$ line ($\approx10GHz$) is larger than the range of common optical frequency shifters (e.g. AOM's), the $D1$ and $D2$ light are created separately using two diode lasers (TA pro and DL pro in figure \ref{exp:laser-table-design}). Both of these lasers are actively locked to the appropriate atomic transitions using saturated absorption spectroscopy to better than $2\text{MHz}$. For the $D2$ path, part of the light ($\approx80mW$) is red shifted and used as the Zeeman slower light ($ZSL$ in the figure) and the rest goes to the $D2$, $D1$ selecting switch, which uses two AOMs (acousto-optical modulator) and a $50$-$50$ cube to feed both the $F1$ and $F2$ path with either $D1$ and $D2$ light. For the $D1$ path, a slave diode is used to amplify the light before going to the switch.\\
\\
In the $F1$, $F2$ path, a tandem and a double pass are used to continiously shift the frequency of the laser (the double pass is also used to shift the light from $F2$ to $F1$). After that, the light in each path is amplified using tapered amplifier and then go through a polarization switch consists of two AOMs and a polarization beam splitter which can but the light into polarization maintaining fibers (MOT/GM and MOT/GM RP) with two orthogonal linear polarizations (the use of these beams is further described in section \ref{exp:mot-cage}). At the end of the chain, two more AOMs are used to control the light we put into the imaging fiber so that we can image on any of the four transitions. Each fibers also has a mechanical shutter that se used to block any possible leaking light that may cause heating.

\section{Vacuum Chamber and Main Coils Configuration}\label{exp:machine-table}

In this section, I am going to describe some important setup on the machine table where out vacuum chamber sits on.

\subsection{Optical Access of the Vacuum Chamber}\label{exp:chamber}
The windows and connections except the top and bottom window on our main vacuum chamber is shown in figure \ref{chamber-light}. There are in total $6$ MOT/Gray Molasses beams, $2$ ODT beams, $3$ Imaging beams, a plug and a Zeeman slower beam going into the chamber. When multiple colors need to be sent in through the same window, they are combined outside the vacuum chamber using appropriate dichroic.

\subsection{MOT-Gray Molasses Cage}\label{exp:mot-cage}
The delivery of the MOT and gray molasses beam from the two in-coupler on the laser table to the six output on the machine table is done with a polarization maintaining evanescent wave fiber splitter which takes the light from the two input fibers and split them equally into the six output fibers. However, the MOT beams and the gray molasses beams have different requirement in beam sizes. On one hand, the MOT needs a bigger beam size for a bigger capture volume. On the other hand, as discussed earlier, for the gray molasses to work effectively, high intensity, therefore smaller beam size, is required. In order to have a different size for the two beams coming out of the same fiber, we send in the two beams with orthogonal polarizations (figure \ref{exp:laser-table-design}) and add polarization dependent beam expenders after the fiber output to shape the two beams differently. This beam shaping is done with a cage system shown in figure \ref{mot-cage-design}. The upper beam path is used for expanding the MOT beam whereas the lower path shapes the gray molasses beam to a smaller size. Each of the four lenses can slide in the cage, which are used to tweak the size and divergence of the beams. The alignment between beams is done with the two bottom mirrors and the two half waveplates between the two polarization beam splitter cubes are used to balance the intensities.

\subsection{Main Coils Configuration}\label{exp:coil}
In our experiment, a lot of different field configurations are used for different purpose. All of these configurations have to be implemented using our main coil which has five independent layers closed to the Helmholtz condition on each sides with sub milisecond switching time between them. A modified H-bridge (figure \ref{exp:coil-control}) was build with IGBTs in order to accomplish these goals using the minimum amount of independent layers, IGBTs and power supplies. The list of possible configurations are shown in table \ref{exp:coil-config}.

\section{Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT) and Compressed-MOT}\label{exp:mot}

The MOT loading is optimized by changing the parameters of the lasers to maximize the number of atoms in the MOT after $6$ seconds of loading. The optimum settings we have found are listed in table \ref{exp:mot-param} and the performance of our MOT can be found in table \ref{exp:laser-cooling}.\\
\begin{table}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
      MOT power&Repumper power&MOT detuning&Repumper detuning&MOT Current\\\hline
      $16$mW&$7$mW&$-38.5$mW&$-28$mW&$57$A\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{MOT parameters}
  \label{exp:mot-param}
\end{table}\\
Since our MOT is mainly optimized for loading rate, it is not necessarily optimized for density and cooling. Therefore, we added a compresse-MOT (CMOT) step after the MOT in order to increase the density and decrease the temperature. In the CMOT step, we ramp the MOT frequency closer to resonance in $4.5$ms and decrease the intensity of the repumper. As a result, the cloud is compressed by radiation pressure and pumped to the $F1$ state. The temperature of the cloud is also decreased because of the decrease in scattering. Figure \ref{exp:cmot-image} shows the F pumping effect in the CMOT and the performance of the CMOT is listed in table \ref{exp:laser-cooling}.

In order to trap in MT, need to go to 2, 2 / 2, 1 which are the only trappable states at both low field and high field.\\
