\chapter{Conclusion}

The main goal of this work was to build an apparatus to experimentally realize a Bose-Einstein condensate of Lithium-$7$ which can be used as a starting point to study quantum magnetism in an optical lattice making use of the light mass and Feshbach resonance. The light mass, small elastic collision cross section and large inelastic collision loss of Lithium-$7$ poses challenges to both laser cooling and evaporative cooling. However, as shown in the previous chapter, using the non-conventional gray molasses cooling and numerically optimized RF evaporation, we have successfully archived our goal and are able to reach quantum degeneracy within $10$ seconds including $6$ seconds of MOT loading time. We have also measured the Feshbach resonance field which is important both for evaporation in ODT and for tuning interactions in a optical lattice.\\

Future work on this experiment will focus on characterizing and stabilizing our BEC and adding in the optical lattice in order to study solid state Hamiltonians we are interested in, including spin Hamiltonians for different phases of quantum magnetism.
