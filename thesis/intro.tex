The presentation of this thesis is divided into two chapters. In the first chapter, I discuss the theory of our experiment, including the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and the various cooling and trapping techniques we use. The second chapter describes the setup of the experiment, the alignment and optimization procedure we developed and the experimental result we have got for each steps.
